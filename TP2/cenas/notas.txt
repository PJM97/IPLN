Aqui vou meter notas e cenas assim que vamos ter de fazer.

Primeiro -> Para a apresentação é preciso descrever o que é uma ontologia:



In computer science and information science, an ontology encompasses a representation, 
formal naming and definition of the categories, properties and relations between the concepts,
 data and entities that substantiate one, many or all domains of discourse.

Tema:
    Pronto: Ontology manipulation.

  As new ontologies are made, their use hopefully improves problem solving within that domain


Ontology is an explicit specification of conceptualization. The term is borrowed from philosophy,
 where Ontology is a systematic account of Existence”
(Tom Gruber and the Knowledge Systems Laboratory at Stanford University).
In computer science, ontology is a formal representation of the knowledge by
a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts.
It is used to reason about the properties of that domain and may be used to
describe the domain. In theory, ontology is a ”formal, explicit specification of
a shared conceptualization”. Ontology provides a shared vocabulary, which
can be used to model a domain that is, the type of objects, and/or concepts
that exist, and their properties and relations.

    O que é ontologia no sentido classico:

    The term ontology comes from the Greek ontologia and means "talking" (-
logia) about "being" (on / onto-). Ontology is a philosophical discipline which
can be described as the science of existence or the study of being. Platon
(427 - 347 BC) was one of the first philosophers to explicitly mention the
world of ideas or forms in contrast to the real or observed objects, which
according to his view are only imperfect realizations (or shadows) of the ideas
(compare [Annas, 1981]). In fact, Platon raised ideas, forms or abstractions
to entities which one can talk about, thus laying the foundations for ontology.
Later his student Aristotle (384 - 322 BC) shaped the logical background
of ontologies and introduced notions such as category, subsumption as well
as the superconcept/subconcept distinction which he actually referred to as
genus and subspecies. With differentiae he referred to characteristics which
distinguish different objects of one genus and allow to formally classify them
into different categories, thus leading to subspecies. This is the principle on
which the modern notions of ontological concept and inheritance are based
upon. In fact, Aristotle can be regarded as the founder of taxonomy, i.e. the
science of classifying things. Aristotle's ideas represent the foundation for
object-oriented systems as used today. Furthermore, he introduced a number
of inference rules, called syllogisms, such as those used in modern logic-based
reasoning systems [Sowa, 2000a].


/*
    Ontologia no sentido da informática:

In modern computer science parlance, one does not talk anymore about
'ontology' as the science of existence, but of 'ontologies' as formal specifications
 of a conceptualization in the sense of Gruber [Gruber, 1993]. So, whereas
'ontology' was originally a science, 'ontologies' have received the status 
of resources representing the conceptual model underlying a certain domain,
 describing it in a declarative fashion and thus cleanly separating it from procedural aspects.




//O que é uma ontologia:
   ontology can be used to describe, in a well
defined and structured way, knowledge about a specific domain. 

Ontologies are a common approach to store knowledge.
